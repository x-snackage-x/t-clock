# A simple Terminal Clock

A simple command line program that displays the current system time in an interesting way.

## Usage

Run the program without any flags for the default clock:
```
wd: ./t-clock
``` 

Use the `-allSeg` flag to show unilluminated clockface segments in a different color
```
wd: ./t-clock -allSeg
``` 

Use the `-useDots` flag to use dots instead of boxes as the pixel shape of the digital clockface.
```
wd: ./t-clock -useDots
``` 

Flags can be combined.
